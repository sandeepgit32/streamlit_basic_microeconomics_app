On a hot summer day at the park, the ice cream stand attracts many visitors. The price of the ice cream decides how many of them will buy the ice cream and in what quantity.

- If the price is low, more people will want to buy ice cream (high demand).
- If the price is high, fewer people will buy it (low demand).

This relationship shows the **law of demand**, which states that, *all other things being constant* (like consumer preferences, income, and the prices of other goods), the quantity demanded of ice cream decreases as the price increases. The following table shows an example of how demand for ice cream changes with price.

Now, let‚Äôs consider the sellers at the ice cream stand. The price of ice cream also affects how much ice cream sellers want to make and sell.

- If the price is high, sellers want to supply more ice cream (high supply).
- If the price is low, sellers will supply less ice cream (low supply).

The reason is because when the price is high, the seller can earn more profit, which incentivizes increased production. Conversely, when prices are low, the potential profits decrease, which discourages production. Sellers may choose to produce less because it may not be worth the cost or effort, leading to lower supply.

This relationship shows the **law of supply**, which states that, *all other things being constant* (like production costs, technology, and the number of people), the quantity supplied of ice cream increases as the price increases. The following table shows an example of how supply of ice cream changes with price.

st.write("""
Sometimes governments intervene to control prices. Let's see how two interventions ‚Äì **price ceilings** and **price floors** ‚Äì affect the market and what unintended consequences may arise:

- If the government thinks ice cream sellers are not getting proper price for their ice cream, it might impose a **price floor** above the equilibrium price, for example, at $5. While sellers would love to sell at such a high price, buyers aren't willing to purchase as much. This leads to a surplus of 20 scoops, with unsold ice cream piling up. Sellers may be tempted to sell scoops illegally below the floor price, creating **black market** conditions.

- On the other hand, if the government thinks ice cream is too expensive for everyone to afford, it may set a **price ceiling** below the equilibrium price, say  at $3. While this makes ice cream cheaper for buyers, it creates a shortage of 20 scoopps because at such a low price, sellers aren't willing to supply enough scoops. This scarcity can lead to **black markets**, where people sell ice cream illegally at higher prices.

    Government interventions can have unintended consequences on the market:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Price Ceiling</strong> - If set below equilibrium, it creates a <strong>shortage</strong> as fewer sellers participate. A <strong>black market</strong> may emerge where ice cream is resold at higher prices.</li>
    <li><strong>Price Floor</strong> - If set above equilibrium, it leads to a <strong>surplus</strong> since buyers purchase less. This can drive sellers to the <strong>black market</strong>, selling below the floor.</li>

# - The **blue curve** represents the demand for ice cream.
# - The **dotted green curve** shows the original supply of ice cream.
# - The **orange curve** shows the new supply after the tax is imposed.

# As a result of the tax:
# - The original equilibrium point is marked in **black**, where the original demand and supply intersect.
# - The new equilibrium point is marked in **red**, where the new supply intersects with the same demand curve.

# This shift indicates that at the new equilibrium, the price of ice cream is higher due to the tax, demonstrating how markets respond to taxation!
